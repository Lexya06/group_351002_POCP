2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-20#1 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch LED_reg[0] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin LED_reg[0]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#2 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch LED_reg[1] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin LED_reg[1]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#3 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch LED_reg[2] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin LED_reg[2]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#4 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch LED_reg[3] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin LED_reg[3]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#5 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch LED_reg[4] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin LED_reg[4]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#6 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch LED_reg[5] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin LED_reg[5]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

LATCH-1#1 Advisory
Existing latches in the design
